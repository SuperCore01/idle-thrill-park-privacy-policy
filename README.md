The privacy of our users is of utmost importance to us at CRAFTEX, Inc. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of data we collect, how we use it, and how we protect it.

Application: Idle Thrill Park Tycoon, the software program provided by the Company. Company: CRAFTEX, Inc., referred to as "We", "Us", or "Our". Device: Any device that can access the Service (e.g., smartphone, tablet). Personal Data: Information related to an identifiable individual. Service: The mobile application Idle Thrill Park Tycoon. Usage Data: Data collected automatically when using the Service. You: The user of the Service.

We may collect device-level data, including device information, approximate location, and advertising ID or other device identifiers. We do not collect personal identifiers (e.g., name, email) unless provided voluntarily for support. Automatically collected data includes IP address, device type and operating system, pages visited, time spent, and crash reports or diagnostic logs.

We may use your data to provide, improve, and monitor our app, fulfill technical or legal obligations, analyze app performance and user behavior, handle support requests, and serve and optimize advertisements. Approximate location refers to city-level location data, which is collected via Google AdMob SDK. We do not use GPS or precise location. This data is used only for ad relevance and is not stored by us directly. Advertising ID is used solely by AdMob to display relevant ads and detect fraud. We do not track users across apps or services, nor do we use this identifier for profiling or personalization within our own systems.

Upon first launch, the app may display a consent dialog (provided by Google or through AdMob) to obtain your permission for personalized ads. You can manage your preferences at any time through your deviceâ€™s ad settings or by visiting the Google Ads Settings page.

We use secure HTTPS encryption for all data in transit, restrict access to data to authorized personnel only, and rely on Googleâ€™s certified infrastructure for ad delivery and analytics. We do not store any personal data on our servers.

We use Google AdMob to serve ads in our game. AdMob may collect and use data such as approximate location and device or advertising identifiers. We share this data with Google (AdMob) for advertising and marketing, fraud prevention and compliance, and performance analytics. For more information, refer to Google AdMobâ€™s Privacy Policy. While we use AdMob as our ad partner, we regularly review their policies and ensure they comply with all global data privacy standards, including GDPR and CCPA. We do not allow AdMob to serve behavioral or sensitive-category ads in our app.

Our app is intended for users aged 13 and above. We do not knowingly collect data from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with data, please contact us. We comply with COPPA (Childrenâ€™s Online Privacy Protection Act) and GDPR-K (General Data Protection for Kids). We do not knowingly collect advertising IDs or location data from users under 13. If we discover such data has been collected, we will delete it immediately. The app includes age-targeted settings to restrict AdMob behavior for minors, including disabling personalized ads and ensuring only teen-appropriate ads are shown.

You can request to delete your data by contacting titaniuminteractivelabs@gmail.com. We will verify and respond within 30 days.

We do not retain any personally identifiable data. Device and usage data collected via AdMob are retained by Google in accordance with their own policies. We do not store or retain this data ourselves.

Our app may contain links to third-party services or websites. We are not responsible for their privacy practices. Please review their policies individually.

We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page, and users will be notified via in-app alert or email.
